> A RAW file (uncompiled) before `.amxx` is in `.sma` format. We need a software to properly create or modify and then compiling it into an `.amxx`.

### Setting up working space
1. Download the AMX Mod X scripting package [here](https://www.amxmodx.org/downloads-new.php) (or [here](https://www.amxmodx.org/downloads-new.php?branch=master) for the newest available).
2. Create and place the `scripting` folder or contents into your project folder. Here's the example:

> [!TIP]
> I recommend to not put the files inside the CS1.6 installation folder, in case when you need to clean install the game it saves you the hassle from doing backups.

#### Now, let's set up our scripting software. There are two softwares that I've used for AMX Mod X scripting.

4. Place it somewhere. `Example: D:/Projects/CS1.6/AMX Studio/(here)`.
5. Open `AMXX_Studio.exe`.
6. Go to `Tools` -> `Settings`.

8. Then save it or press `CTRL + S` and you're good to go.

## What are the difference?
So far, from what I can tell only few differences that's significantly affects experience.

For easy and short scripts, AMX Mod X Studio is <ins>better</ins> because it can show dropdown of function suggestions from the loaded include (`.inc`) files, while VSCode **only** shows suggestion from what are inside the currently opened script file. However, when your scripts has 1500+ line long, VSCode is better because AMX Mod X Studio will lag.
