# Main Setup
## Guide to set up the base game for testing mods or just for fun.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a long step, make sure you followed carefully. A slight miss can lead to game crash/unstable.
> Don't rush it, take your time.

> [!CAUTION]
> This guide is only for single player mode (offline).

### System Requirements
- The same as listed from [CS1.6 Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/10/CounterStrike/)
- Video card / graphics that supports DX11 and OpenGL 4.2+

### Setting up the base game.

1. Download and install this specific version of CS1.6 [here](https://archive.org/details/counter-strike-1.6_202106). ([Why?](#why-must-3266))
2. Download and install latest [MetahookSV](https://github.com/hzqst/MetaHookSv/releases/), choose `blob` version.
   - Copy `cstrike_hd`, `echoes`, `gearbox`, `platform`, `Metahook_blob.exe`, and `SDL2.dll` into your installed CS1.6 folder.
   - Open `svencoop` folder and copy everything into `cstrike` folder.
   - Back to your installed CS1.6 folder, rename the original `cstrike.exe` to something else if exist (as a backup).
   - Rename `Metahook_blob.exe` to `cstrike.exe`
   - Go to `cstrike\metahook\configs` folder, delete `plugins_svencoop.lst` and rename `plugins_goldsrc.lst` to `plugins.lst`.

> [!NOTE]
> #### What is Metahook?
> Metahook is an addon for Goldsrc-based games to give extensive functionality (like ReHLDS and such). Unfortunately Metahook is for Windows only, which is have its specific requirements to be able to use for multiplayer (don't ask me how, I don't know too). Metahook is heavily dependant with newer OpenGL and DirectX (correct me if I'm wrong, it's from my experience since I can't find the system req. docs for it).

3. Run and play your CS1.6 from `cstrike.exe`, play with built-in bots, make sure eveything runs fine, no crash. If you're facing crashes and other, might be your installment/system issue.
4. Inside the game, press tilde `~` symbol on your keyboard, then type _`mh_pluginlist`_. If the output shows as shown on this image below, the Metahook is successfully installed.

5. Make sure the game is stable first before continuing. Play for few minutes or hours to make sure. Also try to change maps, change teams, change classes, etc.
6. Now download this Metahook plugin from [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/nh8ui1ht070k96u/MH_Precache.rar/file).
7. Find and copy the `.dll` file into `cstrike\metahook\plugins`.
8. Open `cstrike\metahook\configs\plugins.lst` with any text editor.
9. Write the `.dll` file name you just copied from the .rar (with the `.dll` text) and save it.
10. Open `cstrike\delta.lst` with any text editor.
11. Find every parameter that contains `modelindex`, `viewmodel`, `weaponmodel`, then change the value from `10` to `16`, and save it.
12. Repeat step 3-5. Make sure the new Metahook plugin is listed after you're typing _`mh_pluginlist`_.

> [!NOTE]
> #### Why specific 3266 build is required?
> The Metahook plugin we're going to use is to extend the precache limit (you read it right). But currently it only works with build 3266. That's why it requires build 3266, which is quite hard to find nowadays. Thanks to archive.org I can find one that easy to download and install without crappy files (clean).

### Installing AMX Mod X
Now, on to installation of AMX Mod X.

1. Download this [package](https://github.com/asdian/CS1.6-Singleplayer-Setup/blob/main/AMX%20Mod%20X%20Starter%20Pack.rar). It contains ReGameDLL 5.26.0.668-dev, SyPB 1.50 (disabled by default), Metamod-P 1.21p38, Printcenter fix, and AMXModX 1.10.0.5467.
2. Extract all the files into _`cstrike`_ folder.
3. Start and run the game.
4. Inside the game, press tilde `~` symbol on your keyboard, then type _`meta list`_ and _`amxx plugins`_. If the output shows as shown on this image below or similar (outputs something, not an unknown command), the package is successfully installed.

5. Make sure the game is stable first before continuing. Play for few minutes or hours to make sure. Also try to change maps, change teams, change classes, etc.

### How to Enable SyPB
1. Open `cstrike/addons/metamod/plugins.ini`.
2. On _`;win32   addons\sypb\dlls\sypb.dll`_ line, delete the semicolon `;` and then save it. If that line doesn't exist just copy-paste it without the semicolon.
3. Open `cstrike/addons/amxmodx/configs/modules.ini`.
4. Find these two lines: _`;sypb`_ and _`;swnpc`_.
5. Delete the semicolon `;` from them and then save it. If those lines doesn't exist just write them without the semicolon. _**Don't write them at the same line.**_
6. On the game lobby, make sure to disable the built-in bot.

7. Repeat the step 3 of [Setting up the base game.](https://github.com/asdian/CS1.6-Tuts/blob/main/CS1.6%20Base%20Game%20Tut.md#setting-up-the-base-game).

> Congratulations!
> -
> Now you have a working base game to start modding. You don't have to worry with 512 precache limit again thanks to that Metahook plugin. It increases the precache to around 1024.

### Installing Metadrawer [Optional]
Optionally, you can install Metadrawer, a Metahook plugin to load images for UI enhancements into the game.

1. Download from [here](https://gamebanana.com/mods/39420).
2. Place `binkw32.dll` and `cstrike` folder into your installed CS1.6 folder.
3. Open `cstrike\metahook\configs\plugins.lst` with any text editor.
4. Write that .dll file name you just copied and save it.
5. Go to cstrike folder, create a file named _`userconfig.cfg`_ (a must, can't use random naming). Not a .txt file, make sure you have done that properly.
6. Write this command: _`md_newmenu "0"`_ inside and save it.
7. Go to `cstrike\addons\amxmodx\configs` folder, open `modules.ini` with any text editor, write _`metadrawer`_ in it and save.
8. Repeat the step 3-5 of [Setting up the base game.](https://github.com/asdian/CS1.6-Tuts/blob/main/CS1.6%20Base%20Game%20Tut.md#setting-up-the-base-game).

> [!TIP]
> Alternatively, you can use [MetaCSU](https://csumods.blogspot.com/2023/06/cs16-plugin-metahook-mhmetacsu-v02.html) which provides around the same functionality. But don't mix them unless you're know what you're doing.

> That's all, you have successfully installed a CS1.6 complete with its addons for modding.
